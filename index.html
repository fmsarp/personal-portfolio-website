                Welcome to my experience. On this personal website, I will be blogging and posting my experience
                with teaching myself the things I believe could be our representation and identity in the future.
                Programming and Web3 will be the focus of articles posted with my personal experience. I hope to keep
                it as short as one page or two at most and the include as much important information as I can. Don't
                worry,
                I will be adding references.
            </p>

                During the 2020 pandemic, I came to realization that between studying art and politics and international
                relations, I lacked the
                skills I could bargain how much I can asked to be paid (my worth). Even though I have a master degree,
                it was not acquired in a
                skill I am interested in. So I started teaching myself programming and getting more involved into
                cryptocurrencies.

                Heard about Bitcoin in 2015 from a friend who worked for an internet cafe back in Ghana. I wasn't able
                to acquire some BTC because it was not easy
                doing it from where I was and had no spare money or source of income to supplement this activity. In
                2017 however,
                this would slightly change after I was trying to find hoe make money online and came across a website
                called "freebitcoin"
                (I will leave referral link below). This website is a bitcoin faucet that gives you free satoshies when
                you visit it every hour and click
                on the "roll" button. I didn't know much about the working mechanism behind crypto at that time so I
                lost much of the sats I acquired. Fast forward
                to today and I still use that website which I have a Youtube video about it on my channel in two
                languagues. I hold onto my sats dearly now since I took
                time when I was out of work in 2021 to learn more about what crypto really is and how it works. I even
                had my own bitcoin node setup in my apartment and hope to be running a node infrastructure company.

                As far back as I can remember, science fiction movies would alwasy catch my attention. Making of
                scienctific cool stuff always caught my interest.
                However, I never had access to the resources needed to build a solid foundation or even find door to set
                my foot in. In 2020, I finally found the
                Raspberry Pi computing board and that has changed everything for me. Started learning the basics of the
                programming with Scratch, hoped on and off python basics
                but what caught my eye most was solidity which I also have the basics of. I realized though that I need
                some more knowledge in web development to be able to master
                frontend and backend development which can further help me with solidity and blockchain development.
                Check out some of my practice work on my github below.
